# Toy Models
This repo contains my toy implementations of models. 

The purpose of this is gain a better understanding of the components, how the parameters affect the results, and get some practice in implementations in general. 

I'm also using this to play around with different libraries (torch, mlx, jax) (i hate tensorflow with a passion) 

Currently implemented models:

Model|Library|Based on?
-----|-------|---------
nanoGPT|mlx|nanoGPT


to do list:
* llama
* chameleon
* show-o
